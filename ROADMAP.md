General
[ ] Multiple worlds!

# Bugs
[ ] When association list is added (a box is checked) it already updates in database - which means if the name is changed, it updates wrong name
    Solutions: it updates by id? or it doesn't update until save button clicked?
[ ] When I edit a birthdate in the event tab, it does not update the character's birthdate
[x] Home bar "New x" (charaacter at least) in the pages not working properly
